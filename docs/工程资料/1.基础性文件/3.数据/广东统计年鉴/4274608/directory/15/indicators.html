                <div>
<p><strong>Length of Railways in Operation　</strong>refers to the total length of the trunk line under passenger and freight transportation (including both regular operations and temporary operations). In the case of wholly or partially double or multiple track railways, calculation is based on the actual length of the first track, regardless of other tracks, station sidings, tracks under the charge of stations, branch lines, special-purpose lines and non-payable connecting lines. The length of railways in operation is an important indicator of the development of infrastructure for railway transport, as well as the foundation for the calculation of passenger-kilometers and freight ton-kilometers, traffic density and utilization efficiency of locomotives and carriages.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Highways　</strong>refers to the length of highways built in conformity with the grades specified by the Technical Standards JTJ01-88 for Highway Engineering, formally checked and accepted by highway authorities and put into use. The length of highways includes that of suburban highways at large and medium sized cities and highways passing through streets at small cities and towns, as well as the span of bridges and ferries. However, it does not include the length of streets in large and medium sized cities and highways built for production purposes at factories, mines, forest areas and agricultural areas. If two or more highways share the same segment, the length of the shared segment is only calculated for once and no duplication is allowed. The length of highways is an important indicator of the scale of development of highway construction, as well as the foundation for the calculation of transport network density and other indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Navigable Inland Waterways　</strong>refers to the length of natural rivers, lakes, reservoirs, canals, and ditches open to navigation during a given period, which enables the transport by ships and rafts. This includes channels open to seasonal navigation for an accumulative period of over 3 months in a year, but excludes river courses used exclusively for wood or bamboo rafts on an irregular basis. This indicator reflects the scale, level and development situation of the inland waterway network.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Civil Aviation Routes　</strong>refers to the length of all routes for regular civil aviation flights. Calculation of route lengths is based on the distance between airports, usually in either of the following ways: duplicated calculation of route lengths, which directly sums up the length of every single air route, or singular calculation of route lengths, which calculates the same segments of aviation routes shared by two or more routes only once. In general practice, the latter is used, as it can precisely reflect the size of the civil aviation network and indicate the extent to which civil aviation serves the national economy and the needs of the people.</p>
<p><strong>Length of Petroleum and Gas Pipelines　</strong>refers to the actual transport distance of oil or gas products, generally calculated as the length of single pipelines. Inclusion of double pipelines and alternate pipeline in the calculation is termed the extension length of petroleum and gas pipelines, which indicates the actual length of the pipelines built. In general practice, the “Length of Petroleum and Gas Pipelines” exclusive of double pipelines is used, which reflects the scale and degree of development in pipeline transport.</p>
<p><strong>Freight (Passenger) Traffic　</strong>refers to the volume of freight (passengers) transported with various means. This indicator provides a quantitative measure of how the transport industry serves the national economy and the needs of the people, as well as an important reference for drafting and checking production plans in the transport industry and for studying the scale and speed of development in the transport industry. Freight transport is calculated in tons and passenger traffic is calculated in the number of persons. Freight transport is calculated in the actual weight of goods regardless of traveling distances and types of freight, while passenger traffic is calculated as the number of individuals traveling once, regardless of traveling distances, ticket prices, whether the passengers are traveling with half-price tickets or child tickets. </p>
<p><strong>Freight Ton-kilometers (Passenger-kilometers)　</strong>refer to the sum of the products of the volume of transported cargo (passengers) multiplied by the transport distance. These are important indicators of the total achievements of the transport industry, as well as the major foundation for drafting and checking production plans in the transport industry and for calculating the efficiency, labor productivity and the cost of transport enterprises. Normally, the shortest distance between the departure station and the destination station (i.e. the payable distance) is the basis to calculate the freight ton-kilometers and passenger-kilometers on. These indicators are calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Freight Ton-kilometers (Passenger-kilometers) = ∑(Freight (Passenger) Traffic ×Transport Distance)</p>
<p><strong>Volume of Freight Handled in Ports　</strong>refers to the volume of cargo passing in and out of the harbor area that undergoes the loading and unloading processes, including mails, checked baggage and bales, as well as fuel, material and fresh water supplies to ships. The volume of freight handled may be classified by direction of flow as import volume and export volume, or by nature of cargo as volume of freight for domestic trade and volume of freight for foreign trade. The classification of volume of freight handled and its direction of flow are important indicators of the production capacity of ports.</p>
<p><strong>Volume of Container Handled in Ports　</strong>refers to the volume of freight handled in Ports that are loaded and unloaded in containers.The unit of measurement is TEU. The number of natural containers of various sizes of containers is converted into TEU (TWENTY FT EQUAL TO UNIT) according to the conversion ratio, that is to say, the conversion ratio is 1:2 for 40 foot container, 1:1.75 for 35 foot container, 1:1 for 20 foot container, and 1:0.5 for 10 foot container.</p>

<p><strong>Motor Vessels　</strong>refer to vessels installed with power units and propelled by mechanical power. It is also known as self-propelled vessels. </p>
<p><strong>Barges　</strong>refer to flat-bottomed vessels driven by drawers or propellers. It has no power units or has only simple power units. </p>
<p><strong>Dead Weight Tonnage of Vessels　</strong>refers to the actual tonnage all the vessels within the reference period are capable of carrying. It equals the tonnage of all the vessels minus that of fuel, material and fresh water, foods, supplies, persons and luggage on vessels.</p>
<p><strong>Coastal Seaports　</strong>refer to seaports located alongside the coasts that have the right facilities and conditions for vessel mooning, passenger boarding and alighting, cargo loading and unloading, and supply of daily life materials.</p>
<p><strong>Inland Ports　</strong>refer to ports located along rivers and lakes that have the right facilities and conditions for vessel mooning, passenger boarding and alighting, cargo loading and unloading, and supply of daily life materials.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Civil Aviation Routes　</strong>refers to the number of all routes of commercial civil aviation flights from one point of the earth to another. Civil aviation routes shall meet three conditions. Firstly, there shall be regular flights. Secondly, there shall be adequate airport and ground facilities to ensure the flight, takeoff and landing. Thirdly, the flights are approved and carried out normally during the flight season. Singular calculation is used in calculating the number of routes. Civil aviation routes are divided into domestic routes, international routes and regional routes.</p>
<p><strong>Civil Aviation Aircraft　</strong>refer to aircraft used in public civil aero transport. They are divided into large and medium sized aircraft and small sized aircraft. The former refer to those with 100 seats and above, and the latter refer to those with less than 100 seats.</p>

<p><strong>Length of Public Transportation Network　</strong>refers to the net length covered by the public transportation routes. The following formula is used: </p>
<p>Length of Public Transportation Network=Length of Public Transportation under Operation - ∑Length of Repeated Routes
<p><strong>Length of Public Transportation under Operation　</strong>refers to the sum of all public transportation routes under operation. The following formula is used: </p>
<p class="center">Length of Public Transportation under Operation= -∑(1/2 (length from starting station to terminal of forward<br> trip+length from terminal to beginning station of backward trip+length of take-turning of both trips)</p>
<p><strong>Number of Vehicles under Operation　</strong>refers to the total number of vehicles under operation in public transportation in cities.

This indicator reflects the overall achievements of postal and telecommunication services during a given period, and is an important reference for studying the composition of business volume and the development trend of postal and telecommunication services. This volume is calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="center">Business Volume of Postal and Telecommunication Services = ∑(Business Volume of Each Product×Constant Unit Price) + Income from Leasing, Maintenance, and Other Services = Business Volume of Postal Services + Business Volume of Telecommunication Services</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Telephone Subscribers　</strong>refer to persons who own mobile telephone numbers and are connected with the mobile telephone communication network through mobile telephone switchboards, including contracted subscribers and pre-paid subscribers for intelligent network.

<p><strong>Number of Internet Subscribers　</strong>include both narrow-band dial-up users and broad-band access users of the internet. Narrow-band dial-up users are further classified into registered dial-up users, pay-per-calling users, and pre-pay card users. Registered dial-up service enables internet access through fixed accounts provided by basic telecommunication operators. Users of this service apply to the operators or their agents for accounts and passwords, with which they dial special numbers for internet connection and acquire dynamic IP addresses through authentification to gain access to the broad-band internet. Pre-pay calling service implies that instead of applying to the operators or their agents, users only need to dial a certain operator’s special numbers to gain access to the internet and pay internet fees together with their calling fees. Pre-pay card users refer to those connected to the broad-band internet through PSTN and N-ISDN networks with accounts and passwords provided by the pre-pay cards. Broad-band access users (exclusive of XDSL and LAN users) refer to users directly connected to broad-band internet nodes through packet networks, DDN networks, frame relay/ATM networks, and special analog or digital lines, bypassing the broad-band IP MAN provided by basic telecommunication operators.</p>
