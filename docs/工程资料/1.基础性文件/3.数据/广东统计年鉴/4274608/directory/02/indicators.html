                <div>
                    <p><strong>国内（地区）生产总值　</strong>指一个国家（或地区）所有常住单位在一定时期内生产活动的最终成果。国内（地区）生产总值有三种表现形态，即价值形态、收入形态和产品形态。从价值形态看，它是所有常住单位在一定时期内生产的全部货物和服务价值与同期投入的全部非固定资产货物和服务价值的差额，即所有常住单位的增加值之和；从收入形态看，它是所有常住单位在一定时期内创造的各项收入之和，包括劳动者报酬、生产税净额、固定资产折旧和营业盈余；从产品形态看，它是所有常住单位在一定时期内最终使用的货物和服务价值与货物和服务净出口价值之和。在实际核算中，国内（地区）生产总值有三种计算方法，即生产法、收入法和支出法。三种方法分别从不同的方面反映国内（地区）生产总值及其构成。</p>
<p><strong>三次产业　</strong>三次产业的划分是世界上较为常用的产业结构分类，但各国的划分不尽一致。根据《国民经济行业分类》（GB/T 4754—2017）和国家统计局2018年修订的《三次产业划分规定》，我国的三产产业划分是：
　<span>第一产业是指农、林、牧、渔业（不含农、林、牧、渔服务业）。</span>
<span>第二产业是指采矿业（不含开采专业及辅助性活动），制造业（不含金属制品、机械和设备修理业），电力、热力、燃气及水生产和供应业，建筑业。</span>
<span>第三产业即服务业，是指除第一产业、第二产业以外的其他行业。</span></p>
<p><strong>劳动者报酬　</strong>指劳动者从事生产活动应获得的全部报酬，既包括货币形式的报酬，也包括实物形式的报酬。主要包括工资、奖金、津贴和补贴，单位为其员工交纳的社会保险费、补充社会保险费和住房公积金、行政事业单位职工的离退休金、单位为其员工提供的其他各种形式的福利和报酬等。</p>
<p><strong>生产税净额　</strong>指生产税减生产补贴后的差额。其中，生产税指政府对生产单位从事生产、销售和经营活动，以及因从事生产活动使用某些生产要素（如固定资产和土地等）所征收的各种税收、附加费和其他规费。生产税分为产品税和其他生产税，产品税主要有：增值税、消费税、进口关税、出口税等；其他生产税主要有：房产税、车船使用税、城镇土地使用税等。生产补贴则相反，它是政府为影响生产单位的生产、销售及定价等生产活动而对其提供的无偿支付，包括农业生产补贴、政策亏损补贴、进口补贴等。生产补贴作为负生产税处理。</p>
<p><strong>固定资产折旧　</strong>指由于自然退化、正常淘汰或损耗而导致的固定资产价值下降，用以代表固定资产通过生产过程被转移到其产出中的价值。原则上，固定资产折旧应按照固定资产的重置价值计算。</p>
<p><strong>营业盈余　</strong>指常住单位创造的增加值扣除劳动者报酬、生产税净额和固定资产折旧后的余额。</p>
<p><strong>支出法国内生产总值　</strong>是从最终使用的角度反映一个国家(或地区)一定时期内生产活动最终成果的一种方法，包括最终消费支出、资本形成总额及货物和服务净出口三部分。计算公式为：
<span>支出法国内生产总值=最终消费支出+资本形成总额+货物和服务净出口</span></p>
<p><strong>最终消费支出　</strong>指常住单位为满足物质、文化和精神生活的需要，从本国经济领土和国外购买的货物和服务的支出。它不包括非常住单位在本国经济领土内的消费支出。最终消费支出分为居民消费支出和政府消费支出。</p>
<p><strong>居民消费支出　</strong>指常住住户在一定时期内对于货物和服务的全部最终消费支出。居民消费支出除了直接以货币形式购买的货物和服务的消费支出外，还包括以其他方式获得的货物和服务的消费支出，后者称为虚拟消费支出。居民虚拟消费支出主要包括：单位以实物报酬及实物转移的形式提供给劳动者的货物和服务；住户生产用于自身消费的货物（如自产自用的农产品），以及纳入生产核算范围并用于自身消费的服务（如住户的自有住房服务）；银行和保险机构提供的间接计算的金融服务。</p>
<p><strong>政府消费支出　</strong>指政府部门为全社会提供的公共服务的消费支出和免费或以较低的价格向居民住户提供的货物和服务的净支出，前者等于政府服务的产出价值减去政府单位所获得的经营收入的价值，后者等于政府部门免费或以较低价格向居民住户提供的货物和服务的市场价值减去向住户收取的价值。</p>
<p><strong>资本形成总额　</strong>指常住单位在一定时期内获得减去处置的固定资产和存货的净额，包括固定资本形成总额和存货变动两部分。</p>
<p><strong>固定资本形成总额　</strong>指常住单位在一定时期内获得的固定资产减处置的固定资产的价值总额。固定资产是通过生产活动生产出来的，且其使用年限在一年以上、单位价值在规定标准以上的资产，不包括自然资产、耐用消费品、小型工器具。固定资本形成总额包括住宅、其他建筑和构筑物、机器和设备、培育性生物资源、知识产权产品（研发支出、矿藏的勘探、计算机软件）的价值获得减处置。</p>
<p><strong>存货变动　</strong>指常住单位在一定时期内存货实物量变动的市场价值，即期末价值减期初价值的差额，再扣除当期由于价格变动而产生的持有收益。存货变动可以是正值，也可以是负值，正值表示存货上升，负值表示存货下降。存货包括生产单位购进的原材料、燃料和储备物资等存货，以及生产单位生产的产成品、在制品和半成品等存货。</p>
<p><strong>货物和服务净出口　</strong>指货物和服务出口减货物和服务进口的差额。出口包括常住单位向非常住单位出售或无偿转让的各种货物和服务的价值；进口包括常住单位从非常住单位购买或无偿得到的各种货物和服务的价值。货物的出口和进口都按离岸价格计算。</p>
<p><strong>新经济增加值占地区生产总值比重　</strong>是指新经济增加值占地区生产总值之比。新经济增加值是指一个国家（或地区）所有常住单位在一定时期内从事新产业、新业态、新商业模式经济生产活动的最终成果，是常住单位进行新产业、新业态、新商业模式经济生产活动的增加值之和。</p>

                <h1>Explanatory Notes on Main Statistical Indicators</h1>
                <div>
<p><strong>Gross Domestic (Regional) Product　</strong>refers to the final products produced by all resident units in a country  during a certain period of time. Gross domestic (regional) product is expressed in three different perspectives, namely value, income, and products respectively. GDP in its value perspective refers to the balance of total value of all goods and services produced by all resident units during a certain period of time, minus the total value of input of goods and services of the nature of non-fixed assets; in other words, it is the sum of the value-added of all resident units. GDP from the perspective of income refers to the sum of all kinds of revenue, including Compensation of Employees, Net Taxes on Production, Depreciation of Fixed Assets, and Operating Surplus. GDP from the perspective of products refers to the value of all goods and services for final demand by all resident units plus the net exports of goods and services during a given period of time. In the practice of national accounting, gross domestic (regional) product is calculated from three approaches, namely production approach, income approach and expenditure approach, which reflect gross domestic (regional) product and its composition from different angles.</p>
<p><strong>Three Strata of Industry　</strong>Classification of economic activities into three strata of industry is a common practice in the world, although the grouping varies to some extent from country to country. In China, according to Industrial classification for National Economic Activities (GB/T 4754—2017) and Dividing Basis of Three Industries revised by National Bureau of Statistics in 2018, economic activities are categorized into the following three strata of industry:
<span>Primary industry refers to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery industries (not including services in support of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery industries).</span>
<span>Secondary industry refers to mining and quarrying(not including support activities for mining), manufacturing(not including repair service of metal products, machinery and equipment), production and supply of electricity, heat, gas and water, and construction.</span>
<span>Tertiary industry refers to all other economic activities not included in the primary or secondary industries.</span></p>
<p><strong>Compensation of Employees　</strong>refers to the total payment of various forms to employees for the productive activities they are engaged in. It includes the employees earn in cash or in kind. It mainly include: wages, bonuses and allowances, subsidies, social insurance paid by company or unit for its staff, supplementary social insurance, housing fund, the pension for the employees of the administrative institution, other forms of welfare and remuneration provide by the units for its employees.</p>
<p><strong>Net Taxes on Production　</strong>refers to taxes on production less subsidies on production. The taxes on production refers to the various taxes, extra charges and fees levied on the production units on their production, sale and business activities as well as on the use of some factors of production, such as fixed assets, land etc. in the production activities they are engaged in. Taxes on production are divided into product tax and other kinds of taxes on production, product tax mainly includes: value-added tax, consumption tax, import duty, export duty; other taxes on production mainly include: House Property Tax, Tax on Vehicles and Boat Operation, Urban Land Use Tax, etc. In contrast to taxes on production, subsidies on production refer to the payment by the government for free to the production units to influence production activities of production units such as production, sales and pricing, which include agricultural production subsidies, subsidies for policy losses, import subsidies, etc. Subsidies on production are therefore regarded as negative taxes on production.</p>
<p><strong>Depreciation of Fixed Assets　</strong>refers to the decline of the value of fixed assets due to natural deterioration, normal elimination or loss, it reflects the value of transfer of the fixed assets in the production of the current period. In principle, the depreciation of fixed assets should be calculated on the basis of the re-purchased value of the fixed assets.</p>
<p><strong>Operating Surplus　</strong>refers to the balance of the value added created by the resident units after deducting the labourers remuneration, net taxes on production and the depreciation of fixed assets.</p>
<p><strong>Gross Domestic (Regional) Product Calculated by Expenditure Approach　</strong>refers to the method of measuring the final results of production activities of a country (region) during a given period from the perspective of final uses. It includes final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation and net export of goods and services. The formula for computation is:
<span>GDP by expenditure approach = final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + net export of goods and services</span></p>
<p><strong>Final Consumption Expenditure　</strong>refers to the total expenditure of resident units for purchases of goods and services from both the domestic economic territory and abroad to meet the needs of material, cultural and spiritual life. It does not include the expenditure of non-resident units on consumption in the economic territory of the country. The final consumption expenditure is broken down into household consumption expenditure and government consumption expenditure.</p>
<p><strong>Household Consumption Expenditure　</strong>refers to the total expenditure of resident households on the final consumption of goods and services. In addition to the consumption of goods and services bought by the households directly with money, the household consumption expenditure also includes expenditure on goods and services obtained by the households in other ways, i.e. the latter so-called imputed consumption expenditure, which mainly includes: (a) the goods and services provided to households by employers in the form of payment in kind and transfer in kind; (b) goods and services produced and consumed by the households themselves (such as self produced agricultural products); (c) financial intermediate services provided by banking and insurance institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Government Consumption Expenditure　</strong>refers to the consumption expenditure spent for the provision of public services provided by the government to the whole country and the net expenditure on the goods and services provided by the government to households free of charge or at reduced prices. The former equals to the output value of the government services minus the value of operating income obtained by the government departments. The latter equals to the market value of the goods and services provided by the government free of charge or at reduced prices to the households minus the value received by the government from the households.</p>
<p><strong>Gross Capital Formation　</strong>refers to the fixed assets acquired less disposals and the net value of inventory, thus including gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories.</p>
<p><strong>Gross Fixed Capital Formation　</strong>refers to the value of acquisitions less those disposals of fixed assets during a given period. Fixed assets are the assets produced through production activities with unit value above a specified amount and which could be used for over one year. Natural assets, consumer durables, small　</strong>instruments are not included. Gross Fixed Capital Formation includes the value of housing, other buildings and structure, equipment and machinery, breeding biological resources, intellectual property right product (expenditure for R&D, the prospecting of minerals and the acquisition of computer software) minus the disposal of them.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in Inventories　</strong>refers to the market value of the change in the physical volume of inventory of resident units during a given period, i.e. the difference between the values at the beginning and at the end of the period minus the gains due to the change in prices. The changes in inventories can have a positive or a negative value. A positive value indicates an increase in inventory while a negative value indicates a decrease in inventory. The inventory includes raw materials, fuels and reserve materials purchased by the production units as well as the inventory of finished products, semi-finished products and work-in-progress.</p>
<p><strong>Net Export of Goods and Services　</strong>refers to the exports of goods and services subtracting the imports of goods and services.　</strong>Exports include the value of various goods and services sold or gratuitously transferred by resident units to non-resident units. Imports include the value of various goods and services purchased or gratuitously acquired resident units from non-resident units. Because the provision of services and the use of them happen simultaneously, the acquisition of services by resident units from abroad is usually treated as import while the acquisition of services by non-resident units in this country is usually treated as export. The exports and imports of goods are calculated at FOB.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage of Value-added of New Economy in Gross Domestic Product　</strong>refers to the percentage of value-added of new economy in GDP. The value -added of new economy refers to the final result of all resident units in a country (or a region) engaging in economic production activities of new industries, new forms of business and new business models during a certain period of time. It is the sum of the value-added of economy production activities of permanent units in new industries, new forms of business and new business models.</p>
