                <div>
                   <p><strong>工业　</strong>指从事自然资源的开采，对采掘品和农产品进行加工和再加工的物质生产部门。具体包括：(1)对自然资源的开采，如采矿、晒盐、森林采伐等（但不包括禽兽捕猎和水产捕捞）；(2)对农副产品的加工、再加工，如粮油加工、食品加工、轧花、缫丝、纺织、制革等；(3)对采掘品的加工、再加工，如炼铁、炼钢、化工生产、石油加工、机器制造、木材加工等，以及电力、自来水、煤气的生产和供应等；(4)对工业品的修理、翻新，如机器设备的修理、交通运输工具（包括小卧车）的修理等。</p>
<p>1984年以前农村的村及村以下办工业归属农业，1984年以后划归工业。</p>
<p><strong>工业统计调查单位　</strong>工业统计调查单位分为两类：独立核算法人工业企业和工业生产活动单位。
<span>(1)独立核算法人工业企业　是指从事工业生产经营活动的单位。独立核算法人工业企业应同时具备以下条件：①依法成立，有自己的名称、组织机构和场所，能够承担民事责任；②独立拥有和使用资产，承担负债，有权与其他单位签订合同；③独立核算盈亏，并能够编制资产负债表。</span>
<span>(2)工业生产活动单位　是指在一个场所从事一种或主要从事一种工业生产活动的经济单位。它包括独立核算工业企业按主营业务活动(即工业生产活动)划分的主营业务活动单位和非工业企业所属的工业生产活动单位（即原非独立核算工业生产单位）。工业生产活动单位，一般应同时具备以下三个条件：①具有一个场所，从事一种或主要从事一种工业活动；②单独组织工业生产、经营或业务活动；③单独核算收入和支出。</span>
<p><strong>轻工业　</strong>指主要提供生活消费品和制作手工工具的工业。按其所使用的原料不同，可分为两大类：(1)以农产品为原料的轻工业，是指直接或间接以农产品为基本原料的轻工业。主要包括食品制造、饮料制造、烟草加工、纺织、缝纫、皮革和毛皮制作、造纸以及印刷等工业；(2)以非农产品为原料的轻工业，是指以工业品为原料的轻工业。主要包括文教体育用品、化学药品制造、合成纤维制造、日用化学制品、日用玻璃制品、日用金属制品、手工工具制造、医疗器械制造、文化和办公用机械制造等工业。</p>
<p><strong>重工业　</strong>是指为国民经济各部门提供物质技术基础的主要生产资料的工业。按其生产性质和产品用途，可分为下列三类：(1)采掘（伐）工业，是指对自然资源的开采，包括石油开采、煤炭开采、金属矿开采、非金属矿开采和木材采伐等工业；(2)原材料工业，指向国民经济各部门提供基本材料、动力和燃料的工业。包括金属冶炼及加工、炼焦及焦炭化学、化工原料、水泥、人造板以及电力、石油和煤炭加工等工业；(3)加工工业，是指对工业原材料进行再加工制造的工业。包括装备国民经济各部门的机械设备制造工业、金属结构、水泥制品等工业，以及为农业提供的生产资料如化肥、农药等工业。
<span>根据上述划分原则，修理业中以重工业产品为修理作业对象的划为重工业，反之划为轻工业。</span></p>
<p><strong>工业总产值　</strong>是以货币表现的工业企业在一定时期内生产的已出售或可供出售工业产品总量，它反映一定时间内工业生产的总规模和总水平。它包括：在本企业内不再进行加工，经检验、包装入库（规定不需包装的产品除外）的成品价值，对外加工费收入，自制半成品、在产品期末期初差额价值。工业总产值采用“工厂法”计算，即以工业企业作为一个整体，按企业工业生产活动的最终成果来计算，企业内部不允许重复计算，不能把企业内部各个车间（分厂）生产的成果相加。但在企业之间、行业之间、地区之间存在着重复计算。
<span>轻重工业总产值的划分也是按“工厂法”计算的，即一个工业企业在正常情况下生产的主要产品的性质属于轻工业，则该企业的全部总产值作为轻工业总产值；一个工业企业生产的主要产品的性质属于重工业，则该企业的全部总产值作为重工业总产值。</span></p>
<p><strong>工业销售产值（当年价格）　</strong>是以货币形式表现的，工业企业在本年内销售的本企业生产的工业产品或提供工业性劳务价值的总价值量。工业销售产值包括的内容为：
<span>（1）销售成品价值：指企业在报告期内实际销售（包括本期生产和非本期生产）的全部成品、半成品的总价值，即按报告期产品的实际销售数量乘以不含增值税（销项税额）的产品实际销售平均单价计算。销售成品价值中包括企业生产的自制设备及提供给本企业在建工程、其他非工业部门和生活福利部门等单位
使用的成品价值，但不包括用订货者来料加工，并且只收取加工费的成品（半成品）价值。</span>
<span>（2）对外加工费收入：指企业在报告期内完成的对外承接的工业品加工（包括用定货者来料加工的产品）的加工费收入；对外工业品修理作业可收取的加工费收入和对内非工业部门提供的加工修理、设备安装等收入。对外加工费收入按不含增值税（销项税额）的价格计算。</span>
<span>对于以对外加工生产为主，对外加工费收入所占比重较大的企业，如果对外加工费收入出现跨年度支付的情况，为保证总产值生产口径计算的准确性，则应将对外加工费收入按实际情况调整，记录本年应实际收取的对外加工费收入。</span></p>
<p><strong>出口交货值　</strong>指工业企业交给外贸部门或自营（委托）出口（包括销往香港、澳门、台湾），用外汇价格结算的产品价值，以及外商来样、来料加工、来件装配和补偿贸易等生产的产品价值。在计算出口交货值时，要把外汇价格按交易时的汇率折成人民币计算。</p>
<p><strong>工业增加值　</strong>是指工业行业在报告期内以货币表现的工业生产活动的最终成果，是企业全部生产活动的总成果扣除了在生产过程中消耗或转移的物质产品和劳务价值后的余额，是企业生产过程中新增加的价值。
<span>计算工业增加值通常采用两种方法。</span>
<span>一是“生产法”，即从工业生产过程中产品和劳务价值形成的角度入手，剔除生产环节中间投入的价值，从而得到新增价值的方法。公式为：</span></p>
<p class="center">工业增加值＝工业总产值－工业中间投入＋本期应交增值税</p>
<p>二是“收入法”，即从工业生产过程中创造的原始收入初次分配的角度，对工业生产活动最终成果进行核算的一种方法，其计算公式为：</p>

                <h1>Explanatory Notes on Main Statistical Indicators</h1>
                <div>

<p><strong>Industry　</strong>refers to the material production sector which is engaged in extraction of natural resources and processing and reprocessing of minerals and agricultural products. It includes: (1) Extraction of natural resources, such as mining, salt production, and logging (but excluding hunting and fishing); (2) Processing and reprocessing of farm and sideline produces, such as rice husking, flour milling, wine making, oil pressing, cotton ginning, silk reeling, spinning and weaving, and leather making; (3) Manufacture of industrial products, such as steel making, iron smelting, chemicals manufacturing, petroleum processing, machine building, timber processing; and production and supply of electricity, water and gas; (4) Repair and renovation of industrial products, such as the repair of machinery and means of transport (including cars). </p>
<p>Prior to 1984, industrial enterprises run by villages and cooperative organizations under village were classified into agriculture. Since 1984, these enterprises have been grouped into industry.</p>
<p><strong>Units of Industrial Statistics Survey　</strong>These are classified into two categories: corporate industrial enterprises with independent accounting system and industrial establishments.
<span>(1) Corporate industrial enterprises with independent accounting system refer to enterprises engaging in industrial production activities which simultaneously meet the following requirements: ①They are established legally, having their own names, organizations, location, able to take civil liability; ②They possess and use their assets independently, assume liabilities, and are entitled to sign contracts with other units; ③They are financially independent and compile their own balance sheets.</span>
<span>(2) Industrial establishments refer to economic units located in one single place and engaged entirely or primarily in one kind of industrial production activity, including units engaged in main business activities (industrial production activities) under industrial enterprises with independent accounting system and units engaged in industrial production activities under non-industrial enterprises (formerly industrial establishments with dependent accounting system). Industrial establishments generally meet the following requirements simultaneously: ① They have each one location and are engaged entirely or primarily in one kind of industrial activity each; ② They operate and manage their industrial production activities separately; ③ They have accounts of income and expenditure separately.</span></p>
<p><strong>Light Industry　</strong>refers to the industry that produces consumer goods and hand tools. It consists of two categories, depending on the materials used:
<span>(1) Industries using farm products as raw materials. These are branches of light industry which directly or indirectly use farm products as basic raw materials, including the manufacture of food and beverages, tobacco processing, textile, clothing, fur and leather manufacturing, paper making, printing, etc.</span>
<span>(2) Industries using non-farm products as raw materials. These are branches of light industry which use manufactured goods as raw materials, including the manufacture of cultural, educational and sports articles, chemicals, synthetic fiber, chemical products for daily use, glass products for daily use, metal products for daily use, hand tools, medical apparatus and instruments, and the manufacture of cultural and clerical machinery.</span></p>
<p><strong>Heavy Industry　</strong>refers to the industry which produces capital goods and provides various sectors of the national economy with necessary material and technical basis. It consists of the following three branches according to the purpose of production or the use of products:
<span>(1) Mining, quarrying and logging industry refers to the industry that extracts natural resources, including extraction of petroleum, coal, metal and non-metal ores, and logging.</span>
<span>(2) Raw materials industry refers to the industry that provides various sectors of the national economy with raw materials, fuels and power. It includes smelting and processing of metals, coking and coke chemistry, chemical 
materials and building materials such as cement, plywood, and power, petroleum refining and coal dressing.</span>
<span>(3) Manufacturing industry refers to the industry that processes raw materials. It includes machine-building industry which equips sectors of the national economy, industries of metal structure and cement products, industries producing means of agricultural production, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides. </span>
<span>According to the above principle of classification, repairing trades engaged primarily in repairing products of heavy industry are classified into heavy industry, while those engaged in repairing products of light industry are classified into light industry.</span></p>
<p><strong>Gross Industrial Output Value　</strong>refers to the total volume of industrial products sold or available for sale in monetary terms during a given period, which reflects the total achievements and overall scale of industrial production during a given period. It includes the value of the finished products in the enterprises, which are not to be further processed and have been inspected, packed and put in storage (where applicable), the income from external processing and the value gain of semi-finished products at the end of the reference period over the beginning. The gross industrial output value is calculated by the factory approach, i.e. the whole industrial enterprise is regarded as the basic accounting unit in calculating the gross industrial output value. No double calculations are to be made within the same enterprise and the output value of different workshops (branch factories) should not be added. However, this approach does not exclude the possibility of double calculations between enterprises, sectors and regions.</p>
<p>Output value of light and heavy industries is also classified by the factory approach. Under normal conditions, if the major products of an industrial enterprise belong to light industry products, the gross output value of that enterprise is classified wholly into light industry; the same principle applies to heavy industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sales Value of Industry (Current Price)　</strong>refers to refers to the total value of industrial products sold or industrial services provided in monetary terms within the current year. It includes: 
<span>(1) Sales Value of Finished Products. Sale value of finished products refers to the total value of finished and semi-finished products sold within the reporting period (including those produced within and outside the period). It equals the actual sales volume of products sold within the reporting period timing the actual average sales price (excluding value added or sales tax). It includes the equipment made by the enterprise itself, as well as the finished products provided to the projects under construction, non-industrial departments and welfare department, and excludes the value of finished or semi-finished products of external processing with supplied materials that produces only processing charges.</span>
<span>(2) Income from External Processing: refers to income from contracted external processing of industrial products (including processing of industrial products using materials from the clients), and the income from industrial repairing work provided to other units. Income from external processing is calculated using information from the item “products sales income” in the enterprise accounting at the prices excluding value-added tax.</span></p>
<p>For an enterprise whose main business is external processing and the charges of external processing constitute a large proportion of its income, in case of cross-year payment, the income of external processing charges shall be adjusted and the actual income of external processing charges of the current year shall be recorded to ensure the accuracy of the coverage of gross industrial output. </p>
<p><strong>Export Delivery Value　</strong>refers to the value of the products that an industrial enterprises have delivered to export units or have exported on its own or per procuration (including those sold to Hong Kong, Macaw and Taiwan), and the value of the products from processing and compensation trades(processing with given materials or samples, assembling supplied components). In calculating the export delivery value, the foreign exchanges shall be converted into yuan at current exchange rates.</p>
<p><strong>Value-added of Industry　</strong>refers to the final results of industrial production of industrial enterprises in monetary terms during the reference period. It equals to the total achievements of all industrial production minus 
the goods and services consumed or transferred during the industrial production of enterprises, in other terms the newly added value during the industrial production of enterprises. It is calculated by the following two approaches:</span>
<span>a) The production approach. The value added is calculated by taking the value of industrial intermediate input out of the final value of products and labor services that comes from industrial production. The formula used is: </span></p>
<p class="center">Value-added of industry = gross industrial output－industrial intermediate input + value-added tax</p>
<p>b) The income approach. It is calculation of the final value of industrial activities by approaching the primary distribution of the primary income of industrial production. The formula used is: </p>
<p class="center">Value-added of industry = depreciation of fixed assets + remuneration of laborers + net production tax+ operating surplus</p>

<p><strong>Total Current Assets　</strong>refer to the assets that meet one of the following requirements: (1) expected to be cashed, sold or used in a normal operation cycle, mainly including inventory and accounts receivable; (2) be owned for trading purpose mainly; (3) expected to be cashed in one year (including one year) from the day of the Balance Sheet; (4) unlimited cash or cash equivalents that can be exchanged with other assets or being capable of settling debts during one year since the day of the Balance Sheet. Included are monetary capital, notes receivable, accounts receivable and inventories. Data on this indicator can be obtained from the year-end figures of Total Current Assets in the Balance Sheet of accounting records.</p>
<p><strong>Accounts Receivable　</strong>refers to creditor's rights formed by business activities such as selling goods, providing labor, which include payment for goods that should be charged to the customer, value-added tax and advance freight for the clients. It comes from the ending balance of Accounts Receivable in Balance Sheet of accounting records.</p>
<p><strong>Inventories　</strong>refers to finished goods or commodities held in preparation for sale in enterprises’ daily activities, goods in the production process, material or the physical materials consumed in the production process or in the process of providing labor, usually include raw materials, goods in the production process, semi-finished products, finished products, goods and materials in flow. It comes from the ending balance of Inventory in Balance Sheet of accounting records.</p>
<p><strong>Finished Goods　</strong>refers to the products that the enterprises have completed all of the production process and accepted and put in storage, and can be sent to the ordering units in accordance with the contract stipulations, or can be on sale. It comes from the debit balance of Finished Products of accounting.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Assets　</strong>refers to houses, buildings machines, vehicles and other equipment, appliances and tools related to production and operation that have been used for more than one year. It also includes articles that are not major equipment of production or operation, but the value of which exceeds 2000 yuan and the service period of which exceeds 2 years. Data can be obtained from the year-end figures of Fixed Assets in the Balance Sheet of accounting records.</p>
<p><strong>Total Assets　</strong>refer to all resources that are owned or controlled by enterprises through previous trades or transactions with expectation of making economic profits. Classified by the degree of liquidity, total assets include current assets and non-current assets. Current assets can be classified into monetary capital, trading financial assets, notes receivable, accounts receivable, advanced payments, other receivables and inventories. Non-current assets can be divided into long-term equity investment, fixed assets, intangible assets and other non-current assets. Data on this indicator can be obtained from the year-end figures of total assets in the Balance Sheet of accounting records.</p>
<p><strong>Total Liabilities　</strong>refer to payable liabilities of enterprises that accumulated from previous trades or transactions with expectation of economic profits leaking out.
