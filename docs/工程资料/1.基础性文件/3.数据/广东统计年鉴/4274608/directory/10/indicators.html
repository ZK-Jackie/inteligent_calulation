                <div>
                    <p><strong>一、城乡一体化住户收支与生活状况调查指标解释</strong></p>
<p>从2012年四季度起，国家统计局对分别进行的城乡住户调查实施了一体化改革，规范了城乡划分范围，统一了城乡居民收入指标名称、分类和统计标准，建立了城乡统一的一体化住户调查，并据此采集全国居民有关数据。</p>
<p><strong>（一）居民可支配收入</strong></p>
<p>居民可支配收入指居民可用于最终消费支出和储蓄的总和，即居民可用于自由支配的收入。既包括现金收入，也包括实物收入。按照收入的来源，可支配收入包含四项，分别为：工资性收入、经营净收入、财产净收入和转移净收入。</p>
<p><strong>工资性收入　</strong>指就业人员通过各种途径得到的全部劳动报酬和各种福利，包括受雇于单位或个人、从事各种自由职业、兼职和零星劳动得到的全部劳动报酬和福利。</p>
<p><strong>经营净收入　</strong>指住户或住户成员从事生产经营活动所获得的净收入，是全部经营收入中扣除经营费用、生产性固定资产折旧和生产税之后得到的净收入。计算公式为：</p>
<p>经营净收入=经营收入-经营费用-生产性固定资产折旧-生产税</p>
<p><strong>财产净收入　</strong>指住户或住户成员将其所拥有的金融资产、住房等非金融资产和自然资源交由其他机构单位、住户或个人支配而获得的回报并扣除相关的费用之后得到的净收入。财产净收入包括利息净收入、红利收入、储蓄性保险净收益、转让承包土地经营权租金净收入、出租房屋净收入、出租其他资产净收入和自有住房折算净租金等。财产净收入不包括转让资产所有权的溢价所得。</p>
<p><strong>转移净收入　</strong>计算公式为：转移净收入=转移性收入-转移性支出</p>
<p><strong>转移性收入　</strong>指国家、单位、社会团体对住户的各种经常性转移支付和住户之间的经常性收入转移。包括养老金或退休金、社会救济和补助、政策性生产补贴、政策性生活补贴、救灾款、经常性捐赠和赔偿、报销医疗费、住户之间的赡养收入，本住户非常住成员寄回带回的收入等。转移性收入不包括住户之间的实物馈赠。</p>
<p><strong>转移性支出　</strong>指调查户对国家、单位、住户或个人的经常性或义务性转移支付。包括缴纳的税款、各项社会保障支出、赡养支出、经常性捐赠和赔偿支出以及其他经常转移支出等。</p>
<p><strong>（二）居民消费支出</p></strong>
<p>居民消费支出是指居民用于满足家庭日常生活消费需要的全部支出，既包括现金消费支出，也包括实物消费支出。消费支出可划分为食品烟酒、衣着、居住、生活用品及服务、交通通信、教育文化娱乐、医疗保健以及其他用品及服务八大类。</p>
<p><strong>食品烟酒　</strong>指用于各种食品和烟草、酒类的支出。</p>
<p><strong>衣着　</strong>指与居民穿着有关的支出，包括服装、服装材料、鞋类、其他衣类及配件、衣着相关加工服务的支出。</p>
<p><strong>居住　</strong>指与居住有关的支出，包括房租、水、电、燃料、物业管理等方面的支出，也包括自有住房折算租金。</p>
<p><strong>生活用品及服务　</strong>指家庭及个人的各类生活品及家庭服务。包括家具及室内装饰品、家用器具、家用纺织品、家庭日用杂品、个人用品和家庭服务。</p>
<p><strong>交通通信　</strong>指用于交通和通信工具及相关的各种服务费、维修费和车辆保险等支出。</p>
<p><strong>教育文化娱乐　</strong>指用于教育和文化娱乐方面的支出。</p>
<p><strong>医疗保健　</strong>指用于医疗和保健的药品、用品和服务的总费用。包括医疗器具及药品，以及医疗服务。</p>
<p><strong>其他用品及服务　</strong>指无法直接归入上述各类支出的其他用品与服务支出。</p>
<p><strong>二、2012年及以前的分城镇和农村住户调查指标解释</strong></p>
<p>2012年及以前年份，中国的住户调查一直分城乡分别开展。由于分别调查，农村与城镇居民收入、支出等指标的统计口径有所不同，数据也不完全可比，城镇调查城镇居民可支配收入，农村调查农村居民纯收入。城镇居民收入与支出数据，指现金收入或现金支出，不包括实物收支；其中，计算城镇居民人均可支配收入和消费支出时，不包括自有住房折算租金，也不包括购建房支出。农村居民收入与支出数据，分为总收支和现金收支，即农村居民的总收支部分包括了自产自用的实物收支；其中，计算农村居民人均纯收入和消费支出时，也不包括自有住房折算租金，但农村居民居住消费支出中，包括了购建房支出。为了保持历史数据的可比，本年鉴中2012年及以前年份的数据和指标解释仍保持了原城镇住户调查和农村住户调查方案的原貌。</p>
<p><strong>（一）城镇住户调查</strong></p>
<p><strong>城镇家庭人口　</strong>指居住在一起，经济上合在一起共同生活的家庭成员。凡计算为家庭人口的成员其全部收支都包括在本家庭中。</p>
<p><strong>城镇居民家庭可支配收入　</strong>指家庭成员得到可用于最终消费支出和其他非义务性支出以及储蓄的总和，即居民家庭可以用来自由支配的收入。它是家庭总收入扣除交纳的个人所得税、个人交纳的社会保障支出以及记账补贴后的收入。计算公式为：</p>
<p>城镇居民家庭可支配收入=家庭总收入-交纳个人所得税-个人交纳的社会保障支出-记账补贴</p>
<p><strong>（二）农村住户调查</strong></p>
<p><strong>农村住户　</strong>指农村常住户。农村常住户指长期(一年以上)居住在乡镇(不包括城关镇)行政管理区域内的住户，以及长期居住在城关镇所辖行政村范围内的农村住户。户口不在本地而在本地居住一年及以上的住户也包括在本地农村常住户范围内；有本地户口，但举家外出谋生一年以上的住户，无论是否保留承包耕地都不包括在本地农村住户范围内。</p>
<p><strong>农村居民家庭纯收入　</strong>指农村住户当年从各个来源得到的总收入相应地扣除所发生的费用后的收入总和。计算公式为：</p>
<p>农村居民家庭纯收入=总收入-家庭经营费用支出-税费支出-生产性固定资产折旧-赠送农村内部亲友</p>
<p>纯收入主要用于再生产投入和当年生活消费支出，也可用于储蓄和各种非义务性支出。“农民人均纯收入”是按人口平均的纯收入水平，反映的是一个地区农村居民的平均收入水平。</p>

<p><strong>II. Explanatory on Indicators before 2012</strong></p>
<p>Prior to 2012, household surveys in China were conducted separately in urban and rural areas. Statistical coverage of indicators of household income and expenditure of urban and rural households were different, data were not comparable completely. Disposable income was surveyed in urban households, and net income was surveyed in rural households. Income and expenditure of urban households refer to that in cash, not including physical payments. Among which, when calculating per capita disposable income and consumption, self-owned housing conversion rental is not included, and expenditure of purchasing housing is not included either. Income and expenditure of rural households are divided into that of total and in cash, that is, total income and expenditure include self occupied physical payments. Among which, when computing per capita net income and expenditure of rural households, self-owned housing conversion rental is not included, but purchasing of housing is included in consumption expenditure of rural households.</p>
<p>For comparable reason, data prior to 2012 in this yearbook were still original urban households and rural households survey.</p>
<p><strong>1. Urban Household Survey</strong></p>
<p>Population of Urban Households refer to members of households living and sharing economically together in the urban areas. All the income and expenditure of all the members of such households are included in the income and expenditure of the household.</p>
<p><strong>Disposable Income of Urban Households　</strong>refers to the actual income at the disposal of members of the households which can be used for final consumption, other non-compulsory expenditure and savings. This equals to total income minus income tax, personal contribution to social security and subsidy for keeping diaries in being a sample household. The following formula is used:</p>
<p>Disposable Income of Urban Households= total household income - income tax - personal contribution to social security - subsidy for keeping diaries for a sampled household</p>
<p><strong>2. Rural Household Survey</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rural Households　</strong>refer to usual resident households in rural areas. Usual resident households in rural areas are households residing on a long term basis(for more than one year) in the areas under the administration of township governments (not including county towns), and in the areas under the administration of villages in county towns. Households residing in the current addresses for over one year with their household registration in other places are still considered as resident households of the locality. For households with their household registration in one place but all members of the households having moved away to make a living in another place for over one year, they will not be included in the rural households of the area where they are registered, irrespective of whether they still keep their contracted land.</p>
<p><strong>Net Income of Rural Households　</strong>refers to the total income of rural households from all sources minus all corresponding expenses. The formula for calculation is as follows:</p>
<p>Net income of rural households = total income - household operation expenses - taxes and fees-depreciation of fixed assets for production - gifts to rural relatives.</p>
<p>Net income is mainly used as input for reinvestment in production and as consumption expenditure of the year, and also used for savings and non-compulsory expenses of various forms. "Per capita net income of farmers" is the level of net income averaged by population, reflecting the average income level of rural population in a given area.</p>
