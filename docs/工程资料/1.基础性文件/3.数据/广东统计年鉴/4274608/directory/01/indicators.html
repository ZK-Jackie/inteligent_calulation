                    <p><strong>行政区划　</strong>指国家对行政区域的划分。根据有关法规规定，我国的行政区域划分如下： (1)全国分为省、自治区、直辖市；(2)省、自治区分为自治州、县、自治县、市；(3)自治州分为县、自治县、市；(4)县、自治县分为乡、民族乡、镇；(5)直辖市和较大的市分为区、县；(6)国家在必要时设立的特别行政区。</p>
<p><strong>发展速度　</strong>用以反映社会经济发展程度的相对指标，根据两个不同时期发展水平的对比而得。由于比较的标准时期不同，发展速度可分为定期发展速度和环比发展速度两种。</p>
<p><strong>增长速度　</strong>发展速度－１（或100％）就是增长速度。即增长速度＝发展速度－１（或100％）。</p>
<p><span><strong>平均每年增长速度　</strong>我国计算平均增长速度有两种方法，一种是习惯上经常使用的“水平法”，又称几何平均法，是以间隔最后一年的水平同基期水平对比来计算平均每年增长（或下降）的速度；另一种是“累计法”又称代数平均法或方程法，是以间隔年内各年水平的总和同基期水平对比来计算平均每年增长（或下降）的速度。具体计算方法，可参照中国财经出版社出版的《平均增长速度查对表》。</span>
<span>在一般正常情况下，两种方法计算的平均每年增长速度比较接近，但在经济发展不平衡出现大起大落时，两种方法计算的结果差别较大。</span>
<span>本《年鉴》内所列的平均每年增长速度都是用水平法计算的。从某年到某年平均增长速度的年份，均不包基期年在内。如1981－2010年平均每年增长速度，是以1980年为基期，2010年为报告期，年份从1981年算起，共30年。</span></p>
<p><strong>当年价格　</strong>是报告期的实际价格，如工厂的出厂价格、农产品的收购价格、商品的零售价格等。按当年价格计算，是指一些以货币表现的物量指标，如工业总产值、国内生产总值等，按照当年的实际价格来计算总量。按当年价格计算的价值指标，在不同年份之间进行对比时，因为包含有各年间价格变动的因素，不能确切地反映实物量的增减变动。因此，在计算增长速度时都使用按可比价格计算的数字。</span></p>
<p><strong>国民经济行业分类　</strong>自2017年统计年报和2018年定期统计报表开始使用新的《国民经济行业分类》（GB/T 4754-2017）。该分类是由国家统计局组织修订，国家质量监督检验检疫总局和中国国家标准化管理委员会于2017年6月30日发布。这次修订是在2011年分类标准的基础上，参照联合国《所有经济活动的国际标准产业分类》（2006年，修订第四版，简称ISIC/Rev.4）进行的。修订后的《国民经济行业分类》（GB/T 4754-2017）共有门类20个，大类97个，中类473个，小类1382个。</p>
<p><strong>企业(单位)登记注册类型　</strong>是以在工商行政管理机关登记注册的各类企业为划分对象，以工商行政管理部门对企业登记注册的类型为依据，将企业登记注册类型分为内资企业、港澳台商投资企业和外商投资企业三大类。内资企业包括国有企业、集体企业、股份合作企业、联营企业、有限责任公司、股份有限公司、私营企业和其他企业；港澳台商投资企业和外商投资企业分别包括合资经营企业、合作经营企业、独资经营企业和股份有限公司等。对不在工商行政管理部门进行登记注册的行政机关、事业单位和社会团体，主要按其经费来源和管理方式进行划分。</p>

                <h1>Explanatory Notes on Main Statistical Indicators</h1>
                <div>
<p><strong>Divisions of Administrative Areas　</strong>refer to the divisions of administrative areas by the state．Relevant laws of the People’s Republic of China stipulate the following principles for the divisions of administrative areas：1)The whole country is divided into provinces，autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government；2) Provinces and autonomous regions are divided into autonomous prefectures，counties，autonomous counties and cities；3) Autonomous prefectures are divided into counties, autonomous counties and cities；4) Counties and autonomous counties are divided into townships，ethnic townships and towns，5) Municipalities under the central government and large cities are divided into districts and counties；6) The state will，when necessary，establish special administrative regions．</p>
<p><strong>Development Rate　</strong>is a relative indicator of the degree of social and economic development calculated through the comparison of two different periods in the degree of development. Development rate can take the form of either fixed-base development rate or chain base development rate.</p>
<p><strong>Growth Rate　</strong>is equal to development rate minus one　</strong>(or 100%), i.e. growth rate = development rate －1 (or 100%)</p>
<p><strong>Average Annual Growth Rate　</strong>Two methods for calculating average annual growth rate are applied in China, one is the more commonly-used “level approach” or the method of calculating geometric average, which is derived by comparing the level of the last year of the interval to that of the base year; the other is called “accumulative approach” or algebraic average or equation method, which is derived by comparing the summation of the actual figure of each year in the interval to the figure in the base year. The detailed calculating methods can be found by reference to the Check Table of Average Growth Rate published by China Financial Publishing House.
<span>Under normal conditions the results calculated by the two methods are fairly close, but they differed sharply when uneven economic development occurred with striking fluctuations in growth.</span>
<span>The average annual growth rates listed in this statistical yearbook are calculated by level approach. The base years are not included when the years are listed for average annual growth rates. For instance, the average annual growth rate of 30 years since 1981 is listed as average annual growth rate of 1981-2010, among which 1980 is the base year and 2010 is the reference year.</span></p>
<p><strong>Current Price　</strong>refers to the actual price in the reference period, such as ex-factory price, purchasing price of agricultural products, retail price of commodities, etc. Total values of some quantum indicators in value terms at current prices, such as gross industrial output value and gross domestic product, are calculated in accordance with actual prices of the current year. When comparing indicators of value over time at current prices, they cannot accurately reflect the changes in real term due to price fluctuations of each year. That is why growth rates are calculated at constant prices.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Classification of the National Economy　</strong>The new Industrial Classification of the National Economy (GB/T 4754-2017) is introduced starting from the compilation of 2017 annual statistics and 2018 regular statistics. The revision, based on the 2011 classification, was organized by the National Bureau of Statistics taking into consideration of the International Standards of the Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (2006，Revised Fourth Edition，ISIC/Rev.4) of the United Nations. The new Classification was promulgated by the National Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine and the Standardization Administration of the People's Republic of China on June 30, 2017. The revised version of the Industrial Classification of the National Economy (GB/T 4754-2017) is composed of 20 sections, 97divisions, 473 groups and 1382 classes.</p>
